# ML_AdverseDrugReactions

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

This project applies supervised machine learning techniques to predict adverse drug reactions (ADRs) from the chemical structure of pharmaceutical compounds. We use a public dataset from Kaggle and enrich it with canonical SMILES generated using RDKit in Google Colab.

## ðŸ’¾ Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle â€“ Dataset for Adverse Drug Reaction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/qwertychuahn/dataset-for-adverse-drug-reaction?select=adr_dataset.csv)
- **File Used**: `data_sample_enriched.csv`
- **Description**:
    - Each row represents a drug compound using SMILES notation
    - 24 binary columns represent different types of adverse drug reactions (ADR)
    - The dataset has been enriched with canonical SMILES using the RDKit library

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

To build a machine learning model capable of:
- Predicting the types of ADRs associated with a compound
- Optionally clustering compounds by similar ADR profiles

## ðŸ§ª Methods Used

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Multilabel Classification (RandomForest, OneVsRest)
- (Optional) Clustering using KMeans
- Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, F1-score, Silhouette Score (if clustering)

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- All modeling and processing is performed in Python
- Canonical SMILES were computed using RDKit from Google Colab
- Dataset enriched and ready for downstream Machine Learning tasks
